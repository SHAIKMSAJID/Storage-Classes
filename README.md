# Storage-Classes
Today I've learnt about Storage Classes
Storage Classes are totally 4. They are
    1.Auto
    2.Register
    3.Static
    4.Extern
The main thing why we should need this Storage classes are to know the extra details of the Variables.
Those details are   1.Default Value
                    2.Location
                    3.Scope
                    4.LifeTime
1.Auto
-------
   Default Value   -   Garbage
   Location        -   RAM
   Scope           -   Local i.e Between the Block or in Function
   LifeTime        -   Between the Block or in Function
Note
----
We can't declare auto in Global.

2.Register
----------
   Default Value   -   Garbage
   Location        -   CPU Registers
   Scope           -   Local 
   LifeTime        -   Block/Function
Note
----
The Switching time between the Main Memory(RAM) and the CPU Processor will be reduced.
We can't declare register in Global.

3.Static
--------
   Default Value   -   0
   Location        -   RAM
   Scope           -   Local
   LifeTime        -   Throughout the Program
Note
----
Updated Values will be automatically considered.
We can declare static Globally.

I've practiced all the programs of the topics separately.
